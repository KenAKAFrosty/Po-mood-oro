# Core Features:

- Traditional Pomodoro timer (25/5 minute intervals)
- Prompt for mood(s) after each session
- Optional quick notes field
- Daily/weekly visualization of:
    - Mood trends
    - Completion rates
    - Time of day patterns


# Goals (roughly in order of importance)
- Keeping scope minimal, aimed to be a "do it in a day" project
- Refine understanding and use of [Effect](https://effect.website), particularly clientside in the browser
- Focus on local-only (but without closing off a way to eventually sync with a server)
    - ^ related to that, wanting to use and understand the IndexedDB API  
- Managing scope (no creep!)
- Look into, understand, and use a data visualization library that isn't D3 and has great typescript support
- Make it inuitive and user friendly so I can use it in my day-to-day (HOWEVER, look at at the NOT Goals section!)
- Oh, and did I say managing scope?

# NOT Goals
- Aesthetics. As noted above, I want it to be inutitive, clear, easy to use. But I don't intend to make it look pretty (managing scope here). A decent font and generous whitespacing is about all I'm going to aim for.
